## Building from source
Note there are two branches kept for this project, main is held at current release, while dev is moving on. To roll-up, kindly follow instruction from https://github.com/Basssiiie/OpenRCT2-Simple-Typescript-Template - with small spice: before `npm run build:dev` run `node rebuildPngToBase64.js`, as base64 version of images used on buttons is then rolled up in plugin.

Visual Studio Code users can clone this repository in editor and use Terminal -> Run task... menu options (including downloading `openrct2.d.ts` into lib directory and running `rebuildPngToBase64.js`)
